# Build a web app in JavaScript

In this project, I will finalize the previus project, where I created an web-page
implementing bootstrap classes.

In this case, I will implement dynamic content with JavaScript (JQuery exactly)

I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that I learned previously.

I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I am free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

Lets Go!
